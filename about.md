## Covidtracker

### About the app

This app is a R Shiny providing graphs and stats about the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.

Available variables are number of active cases (confirmed - (deaths + recovered)), number of deaths, number of confirmed or number of recovered cases, depending on the graph.

Here's rundown of the different tabs available:

  - Total: Evolution of the number of cases for a selection of countries.
  - New Cases: Evolution of the number of new cases per day.
  - Comparison:  Comparison of country profiles from the moment where each country reached a number of cases. You can select where to start with the slider.
  - Map : Map showing the number of cases by country (sorry for mercator projection).
  - Explore Data: Explore raw data tables, by date or by country.
