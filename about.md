### About the app

This is a R Shiny app providing graphs and stats about the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.

Available variables are number of active cases (confirmed - (deaths + recovered)), number of deaths, number of confirmed or number of recovered cases, depending on the graph.

Here's a rundown of the different tabs available:

  - Total: Evolution of the number of cases for a selection of countries.
  - New Cases: Evolution of the number of new cases per day.
  - Comparison:  Comparison of country profiles from the moment each country reached a specific number of cases, selected with the slider.
  - Map : Map showing the number of cases by country.
  - Explore Data: Explore raw data tables, by date or by country.
